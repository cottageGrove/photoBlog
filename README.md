## `React Photo Blog Application`

Photo Blog web app for viewing albums, photos, and posts <br />

The application is designed using React for the front end, and React-Redux for access to props from Redux store.<br />

The application is organized into the following hierarchy<br />
/components<br />
/page-components <br />
/redux<br />

The design of the application ensures that components are separated by their responsibilities. Each component is organized by the specific content data it displays. These can be found in /components <br />



## `Missing features`

The application is missing tests that are needed to check whether the user interface behaves correctly. <br />

There are also no mockups for test cases for components that interact with redux to test access to the Redux Store. <br />

Due to time constraints, there are certain features such as an additional user page to change the current user. The user value is hardcoded for now.
